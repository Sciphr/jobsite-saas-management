always remember to make sure things are all mobile responsive and have dark styling

i use tailwind v4

i use prisma; use that schema as reference for anything relating to a database

when adding new fields to a table, give me the sql queries to do so; don't do the prisma migrations as it never works. Then i will do the db pull/generate myself

buttons should always use the pointer cursor
